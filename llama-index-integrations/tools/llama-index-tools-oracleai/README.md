# LlamaIndex Tools Integration: Oracleai

This API is to generate:

- a summary from a text or a document.
- a list of summaries from a list of texts or a list of documents.

# A sample example

```python
""" get the Oracle connection """
conn = oracledb.connect(
    user="",
    password="",
    dsn="",
)
print("Oracle connection is established...")

""" params """
summary_params = {
    "provider": "database",
    "glevel": "S",
    "numParagraphs": 1,
    "language": "english",
}
proxy = "www-proxy-ash7.us.oracle.com:80"

""" instance """
summ = OracleSummary(conn=conn, params=summary_params, proxy=proxy)

summary = summ.get_summary(
    "In the heart of the forest, "
    + "a lone fox ventured out at dusk, seeking a lost treasure. "
    + "With each step, memories flooded back, guiding its path. "
    + "As the moon rose high, illuminating the night, the fox unearthed "
    + "not gold, but a forgotten friendship, worth more than any riches."
)
print(f"Summary generated by OracleSummary: {summary}")

conn.close()
print("Connection is closed.")
```
